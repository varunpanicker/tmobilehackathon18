       "      <td>12/11/13-Further Update: Chromecast has one big advantage over Apple TV. You can cast content to your TV as the SAME TIME you are using your iPhone vs. the Apple TV. If you use your phone to stream content to an Apple TV you are only allowed to stream content you are watching and you cannot do anything else with your phone while streaming. So the Chromecast advantage is it allows me to check text, e-mails, surf the web or use apps while casting at the same time. You can literally cast Netflix to your TV while watching another video like ESPN on your iPhone at the same time if you wanted to do this.12/4/13-Finally found phone number for Google Chromecast Support. After speaking to rep for 40 minutes still couldn't set up Chromecast using iPhone vs PC liked I tried 1st day (see below) until rep gave up and was just going to e-mail me list of things I should try after our call. I looked at my firewall settings on gateway(modem/router). Security was set at Max/High and this prevented set up. I set to Medium and Chromecast set up completed in about a minute. The rep never suggested looking at firewall settings and put me on hold several times trying to find answer to set up issues. I was now finally able to cast from PC or iPhone. The cast button now shows up within HBOGO, Pandora, Netflix &amp; YouTube Apps on iPhone. I was able to put firewall back on High Security after set up and Chromecast worked properly.But the next day my iPhone refused to acknowledge Chromecast was set up even though TV showed Ready to Cast. Casting from PC worked but not the iPhone. I started to set up like a new device using the iPhone and suddenly the Chromecast showed up as Ready to cast. So it does not work as seamless like the Apple TV.I also had issue trying to pause after phone went to sleep while casting. Since you are not streaming but actually casting you cannot use pause button within apps but must wait for Chromecast to be recognized and use that pause button. When I was able to pause however it started up again and It would not allow me to just display on iPhone or eject until after numerous attempts.12/2/13-Original Review Posted: I used my PC during 1st installation set up attempt vs iPhone. Suggest you use your iPhone for initial set up if this will be your primary casting device vs. a PC. The Chromecast works just fine after setting up using the iPhone.For starters I have iOS version 7.0.4 installed on an iPhone5 which is Apple's most current version. All Apps are most recent versions.I downloaded the Google Cast extension for Chrome on iOS/iPhone. The support.google.com/chromecast/troubleshooterpage indicated the Cast button should be shown within the HBOGO, Pandora &amp; YouTube apps but it is not. I went so far as to delete the apps and re-install trying to fix the casting issue but this made no difference.I am able to cast from within the Netflix app for iPhone only. However, it takes numerous attempts get casting to work as well.I was able to cast once after installation from the PC but now keep getting the message \"Connected to network but can't access the internet\" or \"Brain Freeze, were sorry but something could not load\".And the most annoying thing is the Chromecast keeps knocking off my PC from the wifi network like during the installation process. I have to manually reconnect to my network. This NEVER happened before Chromecast (12/3 I fixed this issue by unchecking connect automatically on start up button which was making Chromecast my desired home network. I hit this button when I had issues trying to set up and thought this might be the reason for set up problems which was really firewall settings)I also have Apple TV. Compared to Chromecast the Apple TV is much better and works seamlessly with about 10 times the more available content but will run you 3X the cost of Chromecast. Depends on your needs.</td>\n",

       "0  12/11/13-Further Update: Chromecast has one big advantage over Apple TV. You can cast content to your TV as the SAME TIME you are using your iPhone vs. the Apple TV. If you use your phone to stream content to an Apple TV you are only allowed to stream content you are watching and you cannot do anything else with your phone while streaming. So the Chromecast advantage is it allows me to check text, e-mails, surf the web or use apps while casting at the same time. You can literally cast Netflix to your TV while watching another video like ESPN on your iPhone at the same time if you wanted to do this.12/4/13-Finally found phone number for Google Chromecast Support. After speaking to rep for 40 minutes still couldn't set up Chromecast using iPhone vs PC liked I tried 1st day (see below) until rep gave up and was just going to e-mail me list of things I should try after our call. I looked at my firewall settings on gateway(modem/router). Security was set at Max/High and this prevented set up. I set to Medium and Chromecast set up completed in about a minute. The rep never suggested looking at firewall settings and put me on hold several times trying to find answer to set up issues. I was now finally able to cast from PC or iPhone. The cast button now shows up within HBOGO, Pandora, Netflix & YouTube Apps on iPhone. I was able to put firewall back on High Security after set up and Chromecast worked properly.But the next day my iPhone refused to acknowledge Chromecast was set up even though TV showed Ready to Cast. Casting from PC worked but not the iPhone. I started to set up like a new device using the iPhone and suddenly the Chromecast showed up as Ready to cast. So it does not work as seamless like the Apple TV.I also had issue trying to pause after phone went to sleep while casting. Since you are not streaming but actually casting you cannot use pause button within apps but must wait for Chromecast to be recognized and use that pause button. When I was able to pause however it started up again and It would not allow me to just display on iPhone or eject until after numerous attempts.12/2/13-Original Review Posted: I used my PC during 1st installation set up attempt vs iPhone. Suggest you use your iPhone for initial set up if this will be your primary casting device vs. a PC. The Chromecast works just fine after setting up using the iPhone.For starters I have iOS version 7.0.4 installed on an iPhone5 which is Apple's most current version. All Apps are most recent versions.I downloaded the Google Cast extension for Chrome on iOS/iPhone. The support.google.com/chromecast/troubleshooterpage indicated the Cast button should be shown within the HBOGO, Pandora & YouTube apps but it is not. I went so far as to delete the apps and re-install trying to fix the casting issue but this made no difference.I am able to cast from within the Netflix app for iPhone only. However, it takes numerous attempts get casting to work as well.I was able to cast once after installation from the PC but now keep getting the message \"Connected to network but can't access the internet\" or \"Brain Freeze, were sorry but something could not load\".And the most annoying thing is the Chromecast keeps knocking off my PC from the wifi network like during the installation process. I have to manually reconnect to my network. This NEVER happened before Chromecast (12/3 I fixed this issue by unchecking connect automatically on start up button which was making Chromecast my desired home network. I hit this button when I had issues trying to set up and thought this might be the reason for set up problems which was really firewall settings)I also have Apple TV. Compared to Chromecast the Apple TV is much better and works seamlessly with about 10 times the more available content but will run you 3X the cost of Chromecast. Depends on your needs.   \n",

       "4  A big downfall of the chromecast to me is that google took away the ability to stream local content. This makes this device almost useless for me in particular now so if you&#8217;re looking for that you should probably look somewhere else. For what it does do it does it well (netflix/youtube/etc). But it seems google is restricting a lot of developers from making this product a great TV/phone/laptop interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "      <td>12/11/13-Further Update: Chromecast has one big advantage over Apple TV. You can cast content to your TV as the SAME TIME you are using your iPhone vs. the Apple TV. If you use your phone to stream content to an Apple TV you are only allowed to stream content you are watching and you cannot do anything else with your phone while streaming. So the Chromecast advantage is it allows me to check text, e-mails, surf the web or use apps while casting at the same time. You can literally cast Netflix to your TV while watching another video like ESPN on your iPhone at the same time if you wanted to do this.12/4/13-Finally found phone number for Google Chromecast Support. After speaking to rep for 40 minutes still couldn't set up Chromecast using iPhone vs PC liked I tried 1st day (see below) until rep gave up and was just going to e-mail me list of things I should try after our call. I looked at my firewall settings on gateway(modem/router). Security was set at Max/High and this prevented set up. I set to Medium and Chromecast set up completed in about a minute. The rep never suggested looking at firewall settings and put me on hold several times trying to find answer to set up issues. I was now finally able to cast from PC or iPhone. The cast button now shows up within HBOGO, Pandora, Netflix &amp; YouTube Apps on iPhone. I was able to put firewall back on High Security after set up and Chromecast worked properly.But the next day my iPhone refused to acknowledge Chromecast was set up even though TV showed Ready to Cast. Casting from PC worked but not the iPhone. I started to set up like a new device using the iPhone and suddenly the Chromecast showed up as Ready to cast. So it does not work as seamless like the Apple TV.I also had issue trying to pause after phone went to sleep while casting. Since you are not streaming but actually casting you cannot use pause button within apps but must wait for Chromecast to be recognized and use that pause button. When I was able to pause however it started up again and It would not allow me to just display on iPhone or eject until after numerous attempts.12/2/13-Original Review Posted: I used my PC during 1st installation set up attempt vs iPhone. Suggest you use your iPhone for initial set up if this will be your primary casting device vs. a PC. The Chromecast works just fine after setting up using the iPhone.For starters I have iOS version 7.0.4 installed on an iPhone5 which is Apple's most current version. All Apps are most recent versions.I downloaded the Google Cast extension for Chrome on iOS/iPhone. The support.google.com/chromecast/troubleshooterpage indicated the Cast button should be shown within the HBOGO, Pandora &amp; YouTube apps but it is not. I went so far as to delete the apps and re-install trying to fix the casting issue but this made no difference.I am able to cast from within the Netflix app for iPhone only. However, it takes numerous attempts get casting to work as well.I was able to cast once after installation from the PC but now keep getting the message \"Connected to network but can't access the internet\" or \"Brain Freeze, were sorry but something could not load\".And the most annoying thing is the Chromecast keeps knocking off my PC from the wifi network like during the installation process. I have to manually reconnect to my network. This NEVER happened before Chromecast (12/3 I fixed this issue by unchecking connect automatically on start up button which was making Chromecast my desired home network. I hit this button when I had issues trying to set up and thought this might be the reason for set up problems which was really firewall settings)I also have Apple TV. Compared to Chromecast the Apple TV is much better and works seamlessly with about 10 times the more available content but will run you 3X the cost of Chromecast. Depends on your needs.</td>\n",

It only worked on my 2 newest TV's that both have Wifi and internet TV built-in already.  Kinda defeats the purpose of buying Apple TV doesn't it...), I tried the Google Chromecast device.  Plugged it in the HDMI port, used the USB port of the TV to power the Chromecast device and 2 minutes later, I was up and running.  Works great as long as you only use one device to transmit video to it (I was using my Iphone 5 and it worked great).  When I also tried streaming with my HP laptop, the device got confused and I had to power it down.  After that it worked great.  If you know this and don't use 2 devices at the same time to try to stream video to the Chromecast, it works wonderfully.  For the low price, I would recommend it to anyone!  I bought 3 of them to get the TV's that don't have internet capability in our house yet, connected to the WWW.</td>\n",

Stream anything you want from your laptop from your chrome browser.  Depending on my internet speed, it can lag a few seconds sometimes and sometimes starts getting jerky.  What many people do not know is that you can actually transmit your desktop as well after you connect your laptop through your chrome browser and beam office documents and anything else open on your desktop as well.  BUT IT DOES NOT transmit sound from any application unless it is from Google Chrome.  I am hoping google would come out with a solution for this.

       "      <td>As a fan of Google TV from the beginning, I have to say that I was intrigued by the idea of the Chromecast.  It basically sets up the idea that apps for your TV don't actually have to be powered by your TV or a device connected to your TV, but instead, powered by your smart phone, tablet or Chrome browser.  This allows for the cost of the streaming device to be significantly reduced, instead of the higher priced Google TV and Apple TV devices of the past few years.The Chromecast is essentially this:  a device that responds to commands from various apps on your smart phone, tablet or Chrome browser.  These commands tell the Chromecast to begin to pull the stream from your wireless router.  Some reviews I have seen incorrectly stated that the Chromecast is just a wireless HDMI device which relies on the tablet, smart phone or other originating device to actually play content, and then mirror it on the TV screen.  This is not the case, except for when you are using a Chromebook Pixel to mirror what you are doing in Chrome.When not mirroring, the Chromecast does great!  Just as good as a Google TV or Apple TV device.  However, when mirroring on a Chromebook Pixel, video lags tremendously, so don't think you are going to be able to watch all sorts of alternative streaming sites that aren't supported directly, just because you can mirror your device.That being said, more and more apps are being added to the support list every month!The only other downfall I see is that you still have to switch inputs on your TV to use it.  After being babied by the integration with regular TV that Google TV affords, I myself do not wish to use a Chromecast in its current form.  However, for those that have cut the cable already, and don't watch regular HD broadcast TV, then it's a perfect fit!I gave it 4 stars due to the lack of a coaxial input for regular broadcast TV to be integrated (as Google TV does) which requires you to switch inputs, as well as due to the fact that it lags so much when mirroring content with a Chromebook Pixel.</td>\n",

This device, though was practically made for connecting YouTube to my TV and controlling it with my Samsung Galaxy Note II or my wheezing old Windows XP laptop.Yes, this will do more than YouTube, but I also have a Roku and that does the Amazon Prime movies I want. This is my YouTube box and it works perfectly.  Installation entailed first plugging this into one of the two HDMI ports on my TV and attaching power. Since my TV has an USB port I use it for power, but the device comes with a wall wart for a USB cable too. The next step required downloading the Chromecast and YouTube apps for my Note II and connecting to my network. Now when I bring up YouTube there is a 'Cast' icon I can press to watch whichever videos or clips I bring up in a search or from my favorites.The app I loaded also will detect and work on my friend's Chromecast when I am at her house, so in a way this is a universal remote. She is using an iPhone 4S and went through basically the same install process, although she is also using NetFlix with hers. Like me she has a Roku plugged into her second HDMI port. She uses that device more than I do, but out needs are different.Overall, I can heartily recommend this for folks who spend a lot of time on YouTube, even if they have another streaming box like the Roku. I am not so sure that I would get this as a general purpose streaming device - at least at this point - if I wanted movies from other sources. In that category the Roku seems to have many more options (at this point in time) and is a more mature and versatile platform. However, for YouTube this is THE solution in my opinion.</td>\n",

I then compare that to what users feel the product should do and provide a Pro's which explains areas that the product goes above and beyond with their functionalities and Con's where I (my personal feeling) recommend areas I believe the product should improve in.  Star's are taken away from the product when it fails to deliver what the manufacturer said the product could do.The Chromecast viewer is a great viewer display technology.  It definitely makes TV watching easy, economical and practical.  Big different that consumers should be aware of, this is not a Roku or an Apple TV competitor.  Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.  Same applies for the phone, i only have apps that are compatible with Chromecast so no issues there.  But i am sure in this community of users that have different needs that maybe an impact somewhere down the line, but for 35 bucks amazing product.Pros:-  Easy to setup.  Not difficult at all but it does require a degree of understanding of your TV an knowing your wifi password.-  Delay is pretty amazing, from computer to Chromecast only about a 1 second delay.  Beats the pants off of Netgear's products and Windows 8 screen display technology-  Audio quality is great, its an HDMI adapter so make sure you have HDMI on your TV-  The software needed to run is simple to use.  One click of a button and its up and running.-  Small and non intrusive.Cons:-  Google needs to add better user instructions on setup.  I know they have a guide but it would be nice on screen-  A win 32 agent or a .dmg app would be nice.  I understand its more to maintain but for this type of technology it would be nice to be able to see local machine videos and movies.

One is used in a guest room at home, while the other is used in a commercial environment to drive a HDTV used for internal announcements (for now).I only use Apple products (iOS and OS X) at home. At work- we currently use a PC with the Chrome Chromecast plugin.I'll start with the home environment:When it works, it is great. I've had recurring issues connecting to it though, and re-connecting after locking a device. I mostly just use it in the Netflix app, so I suppose the blame could be pointed at them, but since this was a \"flagship\" app- I expect better. After the Chromecast starts- it often takes a couple of re-starts of the Netflix app to get it to show up. It rarely shows up when I first launch the Netflix app. I've also occasionally had to restart the Chromecast to get it to show up as an option as-well. I've also had problems re-connecting to control the Chromecast after playback has started but the device goes to sleep. Just to try to illustrate this...I will wait until the Chromecast shows it's online (in its screen-saver).I'll start Netflix on my iPad or iPhone, and start playing a movie or TV show. More often than not- the Chromecast icon won't show up.I'll have to force-quite Netflix, start it again. I may have to repeat this a couple of times.Eventually- the Chromecast icon will show up and I can play the show via it on the HDTV, controlling it on the device.Now, eventually my device will go to sleep/lock to save power. The show will continue playing on the Chromecast. (This is good.)If I open up Netflix on my device again- there seems to be about a 50% chance that it won't show the Chromecast controls or even acknowledge that the Chromecast is there again.Sometimes- I can restart the app and reconnect to the Chromecast. Often the only way to actually shut down the show streaming via the Chromecast is to power it off.I believe all of this is due to poor Wifi management stability on the Chromecast.I've used it on an iPhone and two different iPads, all have the same stability issues.Similarly- we have problems with the one used commercially as-well. It frequently disconnects from the WiFi network, or from the Chrome browser we show the content in. The Chromecast itself is line-of-sight to a commercial WiFi hotspot and less than 10' away from it. So- the display we are trying to drive more-often-than-not shows the Chromecast screen saver, and not the browser content. The browser content is on a dedicated PC with no power management or even screen-saver turned on. It is on the same WiFi network.On a related note- we found the Chromecast plug-in for Chrome on Mac to be completely worthless. It will often not even show the Chromecast, and when it does- it disconnects within a minute every time. We can't get anything to stream to it from a Mac for more than a few seconds. iPads and iPhones work fine, except they have the same stability problems for the initial connection and control interface as the home unit does. Streaming from the Chrome browser on iDevices is currently not supported, so that isn't an option.I'm sure it probably works flawlessly on a newer Android device, but if you have Apple products- you are better off with an Apple TV, and I can't recommend it if you want to stream from a PC Web browser. This is a relatively new product, and I'm sure they will introduce stability enhancements over-time. You can't beat it for the price, obviously, which is why I am still giving it three stars. When it is actually streaming- the video quality seems to be on-par with other streaming media players. At this point- it is definitely not a substitute for more-advanced streamers like AppleTV or Roku. That may change, and if I notice an improvement- I'll update this review. As of now- we are pulling it from the commercial install and switching to a long HDMI cable. (We were trying to minimize cables, and though the Chromecast would be a great solution.) At home- I will continue to use it, and just deal with the disconnects for now. If I used that room more often- I would swap it out for an AppleTV or Roku.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Update:Using the Chromecast for however long it has been out now, I like it. However, I kind of wish I invested in a good HDMI for my laptop instead.  I never cast YouTube or Netflix from my iPad or my phone, which leaves using it exclusively for my laptop.  I hear the tab-casting is still in beta mode, but I wish it was better. Netflix and YouTube are not the movie/film-viewing sites that I often use, and any other sites would experience delay/lagging/disconnection with the tab casting via the Chrome browser.  I've seen my sister use her phone to cast Netflix onto your family TV and it works superbly (you can even leave the house or your phone can die and it will still play).  The tab casting, I feel, relies on good reliable internet.  If you don't have a good connection, don't have any hopes of watching anything on the TV.  However, even with the best connection (which I have), you WILL experience technical difficulties.  It's still a good product, but there are still major improvements that need to be made.  Not worth the price for where it is, developmentally speaking.//I initially ordered a Chromecast from the Google website and it just came in last night. Although I haven't had it for too long, I'm sure I know of how well or poorly it works.The dongle itself is great, it saves the hassle of having to connect a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable to watch something on the big screen. My TV actually has a USB port, so an external source of power was not necessary. The dongle powers up by itself after the TV is turned on, and the input is selected (depending on where you inserted the Chromecast). I initially had trouble, I couldn't get the set up screen to come up. I only had a black screen with a few white dots at 480p. After going online to learn how to trouble shoot it, it turns out all I needed to do was unplug it, click the reset button a couple of times (to make sure it wasn't jammed), and then plug it back in. The set up was easy. Downloaded and installed Chromecast on all of my devices (both Android and IOS) in no time.For the longest time, I've been using my TV as an external monitor, more for movies than anything. The fact that I am unable to see documents on the big screen (like I ever did that anyways) is tad disheartening, but I got over it. It takes a little while for something to be cast on to the TV, and at times, the connection can fail (I had it happen once so far).  The Youtube app had to be cast and then loaded before what I was watching was on the screen. Having something casted isn't as instantaneous as I had hoped, but I'm willing to work with it.I don't often use Netflix or Amazon for movies. I'm more preferential toward third-party sites for my movies. I was worried that the movies wouldn't cast on my Macbook, but it did. But when it did, I was worried I'd have to watch it small-screen with the Google Chrome browser clearly evident. However, I noticed that after I clicked the full-screen button, the movie expanded on both my Macbook and the TV, but, you can still multi-task due to the multiple desktop function of the Macbook (which is a lifesaver)! Simply swipe to another desktop to start/continue working on something else.I'm still in the process of looking for an extension or app of Google Chrome that would allow me to play music from my Itunes, which would make the Chromecast amazing in all aspects. But so far, my searches have come up empty-handed.For a small, convenient dongle that allows you to cast and watch movies from electronic devices to the big screen, the price is great. A decent Thunderbolt to HDMI cable would cost as much, and wouldn't allow you to connect your devices to the TV. For $35, it's a good buy. I'm hoping that there will be more updates to improve the 'syncing' and smooth playing of the movies and media. Other than that, I see no problem with it. I'm actually ordering another one from Amazon for my parents (it costs less than Google because of the shipping).Easy to use.Convenient.Try it!</td>\n",

Hopefully support for other apps will show up soon.Negatives:Laptop mirroring was terrible. The mirrored screen from my MBA on my TV was extremely poor in quality, pretty much un-readable.The mirroring was also very slow. There's about a 1-2 second lag time from what you see on the laptop to what you see on your TV screen.I was mostl excited about the mirroring feature on my Chromecast. But I was extremely disappointed in the results.Overall, disappointing mirroring performance.

Lack of local media sharing capabilities really was the deal breaker for me. They seemed to have listened to all the complaints, and woken up to the swell of competition coming out of cheap overseas devices.EDIT 03-15-14: WARNING, Google just forced an update download on this unit. This unit will no longer setup without an internet connection, and will not function at an isolated guest network AP. Be aware, if you are planning to use this device on the road, such as at a hotel or other place where you will not have administrative capacity to configure the wireless router, this device will probable have problems, where as Tronsmart &amp; Cheerlink like devices will function. Tronsmart &amp; Cheerlink both function over their own AP network (in otherwords, they create their own little WiFi network), so they can function even in places without any other equipment, just a phone, a TV, and the HDMI adapter. Google Chromecast REQUIRES an external WiFi router to be connected to. It will not even setup without an internet connection. Google, one step forward, two steps back.I GAVE it a better rating after repurchasing it and testing out its capabilities. It can now cast local streaming content from the various apps that are available that perform this type of streaming. It comes packaged with a small extension for poorly designed TVs with tight fitting HDMI port on the back. Also comes with a standard wall jack adapter in addition to the USB for power, whereas most of the other devices I've purchased only comes with the USB cable, or is a split cord with WiFi/antenna unit. The setup is NO LONGER straightforward, due to the recent forced update download.Only three small drawbacks I see so far with this unit.[1] I can not connect this if I am using a hidden non-broadcasting SSID on my network. The other similar casting devices I own can.[2] Forced upgrades. The other devices I own require me to upgrade the firmware/software. Chromecast does it automatically without my permission or consent. This worries me. This type policy leaves the unit open to abuse. If some CEO at Google decides to take this in a new direction and changes the functionality that I don't like (for example, implementing DRMs or collecting market research data, etc.), there's not a whole lot I can do about it. I'll have to be lucky enough to catch wind of it before I plug mine in and be careful to only use the device when it can't connect to internet. It is also a poor way to do it, for technicalities. If I happen to be on a really terrible internet connection, the update could take a long time, and I might prefer to do this when I'm on a better connection. If I need the unit to simply function, for example, I'm late for meeting where I need to use this unit for a presentation, this would not be an appropriate time to perform an update. Bottom line, updating ought to be my choice of whether, when and where.[3] I still can't mirror my phone for those situations where apps are not supported but I want to throw their image up on the TV anyway. From what I hear we aren't too far from it though as the SDKs were released (Koush was working on one). EDIT 03-15-14: I now see some Apps coming out for mirroring. Unfortunately, due to the recent update Google forced on my unit, it will be sometime before I can get a chance to reconfigure my Chromecast to test this functionality.Hopefully, other large companies will learn from this earlier fiasco, and stop trying to force subscriptions &amp; partnerships on it's customers. Such actions will only invite smaller competitors to develop solutions that the customers want, that these larger corporations try to lock down. Now that the SDKs are available, they will see how much better this strategy is. People will figure out new and wonderful ways of using this technology, and Google can reap the benefits together, with increased unit sales and visibility, instead of fighting against the customers for control and losing in public relations.A step in the right direction. Open it up. If everyone shares in it's development, everyone gets a bigger benefit from it. Even you, Google. It's a win/win.</td>\n",

       "0     12/11/13-Further Update: Chromecast has one big advantage over Apple TV. You can cast content to your TV as the SAME TIME you are using your iPhone vs. the Apple TV. If you use your phone to stream content to an Apple TV you are only allowed to stream content you are watching and you cannot do anything else with your phone while streaming. So the Chromecast advantage is it allows me to check text, e-mails, surf the web or use apps while casting at the same time. You can literally cast Netflix to your TV while watching another video like ESPN on your iPhone at the same time if you wanted to do this.12/4/13-Finally found phone number for Google Chromecast Support. After speaking to rep for 40 minutes still couldn't set up Chromecast using iPhone vs PC liked I tried 1st day (see below) until rep gave up and was just going to e-mail me list of things I should try after our call. I looked at my firewall settings on gateway(modem/router). Security was set at Max/High and this prevented set up. I set to Medium and Chromecast set up completed in about a minute. The rep never suggested looking at firewall settings and put me on hold several times trying to find answer to set up issues. I was now finally able to cast from PC or iPhone. The cast button now shows up within HBOGO, Pandora, Netflix & YouTube Apps on iPhone. I was able to put firewall back on High Security after set up and Chromecast worked properly.But the next day my iPhone refused to acknowledge Chromecast was set up even though TV showed Ready to Cast. Casting from PC worked but not the iPhone. I started to set up like a new device using the iPhone and suddenly the Chromecast showed up as Ready to cast. So it does not work as seamless like the Apple TV.I also had issue trying to pause after phone went to sleep while casting. Since you are not streaming but actually casting you cannot use pause button within apps but must wait for Chromecast to be recognized and use that pause button. When I was able to pause however it started up again and It would not allow me to just display on iPhone or eject until after numerous attempts.12/2/13-Original Review Posted: I used my PC during 1st installation set up attempt vs iPhone. Suggest you use your iPhone for initial set up if this will be your primary casting device vs. a PC. The Chromecast works just fine after setting up using the iPhone.For starters I have iOS version 7.0.4 installed on an iPhone5 which is Apple's most current version. All Apps are most recent versions.I downloaded the Google Cast extension for Chrome on iOS/iPhone. The support.google.com/chromecast/troubleshooterpage indicated the Cast button should be shown within the HBOGO, Pandora & YouTube apps but it is not. I went so far as to delete the apps and re-install trying to fix the casting issue but this made no difference.I am able to cast from within the Netflix app for iPhone only. However, it takes numerous attempts get casting to work as well.I was able to cast once after installation from the PC but now keep getting the message \"Connected to network but can't access the internet\" or \"Brain Freeze, were sorry but something could not load\".And the most annoying thing is the Chromecast keeps knocking off my PC from the wifi network like during the installation process. I have to manually reconnect to my network. This NEVER happened before Chromecast (12/3 I fixed this issue by unchecking connect automatically on start up button which was making Chromecast my desired home network. I hit this button when I had issues trying to set up and thought this might be the reason for set up problems which was really firewall settings)I also have Apple TV. Compared to Chromecast the Apple TV is much better and works seamlessly with about 10 times the more available content but will run you 3X the cost of Chromecast.

       "4     A big downfall of the chromecast to me is that google took away the ability to stream local content. This makes this device almost useless for me in particular now so if you&#8217;re looking for that you should probably look somewhere else. For what it does do it does it well (netflix/youtube/etc). But it seems google is restricting a lot of developers from making this product a great TV/phone/laptop interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6     After a bad experience with Apple TV (did not work, since my 50&#34; plasma TV did not have the HDCP security protocol, which most TV's before 2010 or so do not seem to have.  It only worked on my 2 newest TV's that both have Wifi and internet TV built-in already.  Kinda defeats the purpose of buying Apple TV doesn't it...), I tried the Google Chromecast device.  Plugged it in the HDMI port, used the USB port of the TV to power the Chromecast device and 2 minutes later, I was up and running.  Works great as long as you only use one device to transmit video to it (I was using my Iphone 5 and it worked great).  When I also tried streaming with my HP laptop, the device got confused and I had to power it down.  After that it worked great.  If you know this and don't use 2 devices at the same time to try to stream video to the Chromecast, it works wonderfully.  For the low price, I would recommend it to anyone!  I bought 3 of them to get the TV's that don't have internet capability in our house yet, connected to the WWW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Yes, I know it can also share your chrome browser, but that is laggy and lame.Thanks google, you fooled me again into buying another beta product with no future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8     After a few months of owning this thing, I'm finding it useful for pushing youtube videos to my computer, but that's about it. You can stream Netflix with this, but I turned my Netflix streaming off because I wasn't using it enough to keep paying for it. Other than that, it's a nifty little device. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that setting it up is a little bit of a hassle as you have to have a computer with internet in order to setup. Should be out of the box ready in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "9     A great buy for the money.  but if it was any more expensive than $35, i would have given it only 4 stars.  For the price, the utility is provides is great.  Stream anything you want from your laptop from your chrome browser.  Depending on my internet speed, it can lag a few seconds sometimes and sometimes starts getting jerky.  What many people do not know is that you can actually transmit your desktop as well after you connect your laptop through your chrome browser and beam office documents and anything else open on your desktop as well.  BUT IT DOES NOT transmit sound from any application unless it is from Google Chrome.  I am hoping google would come out with a solution for this.  But alternatively you can use a bluetooth speaker and stream it out of that (if your laptop has bluetooth enabled).  But otherwise it works as they claim. I love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "11    A great toy! I can now stream Netflix and Youtube content directly to my TV. No longer do I have to rely on a cable to connect my laptop to my TV. That said; it dos not work correctly on all streaming sites. But Google is working on it. The option to mirror your laptop screen is still in BETA and a bit laggy. One serious letdown, is it's inability to transmit in 1080p, you are stuck with the high-end of 720p at best.All in all a great stocking stuffer for the geek in your life.PS. it comes with a USB cable which can be used to power the device if your TV has one and an HDMI extender for those TV's with hard to reach ports!Update: it's ability to mirror your laptops' screen is NOT compatible with Windows 8. When you switch to the \"Tiles\" mode nothing happens.

       "15    All the &#34;other&#34; reviews candy coat the fact that at this stage it's an inferior product. When casting to my HDTV 10 feet away from my windows 7 laptop I get a lousy &#34;standard&#34; picture and lag time. The fact it also has issues with quicktime/silverlight/netflix and other plug ins is ridiculous. While it seems small, the girth of the unit requires the use of the extention cord to fit alongside other HD cords. Hey, what do you expect from the folks who brought you a&#34;spy&#34; droid. Of course it's really just a way to get you to use Chrome. Apple user?

Set-up is a cinch. If your TV lacks a USB port to power it then you use the included power cord so installation is always a success if you've got a spare HDMI port. Network configuration is easy if you are accessing wifi directly. The only down side isn't the device's fault ... when there's an interstitial web site for setting up wifi (as in a hotel room) then the device can't gain access. It's so small that I carry one with me with I travel. Why do I have five? Because I think they're so cool that I've purchased three and given them away. Highly recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "18    Already an Internet video household, the Chromecast makes it so much simplier and slick. The services supported all work great with it (varying degrees of polish depending on what you're using) and the fact it does not tie up the device being used is a great plus. The expandability of it is genius and we look forward to doing even more with it as more services make use of it. This particular purchase was a gift (it was one of the few &#34;day one&#34; purchases I've made) and I'm pretty sure we've sold a few others by demo, word of mouth, etc. For what it does, it does it extremely well and the cost can't be beat. This will turn any modern TV into a streaming powerhouse without the need for poorly laid out custom software on TVs or set top boxes. Highly recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "19    Although I already have Apple TV, I wanted to try out Chromecast.  The setup was simple enough (I did it from my iPad).For the iPad app, there is only links to Netflix and YouTube.  They both worked well.  Though I had closed the Netflix app on the iPad, it kept playing on the TV via Chromecast.  I tried to stop it by reopening Netflix but it wouldn't connect me to Chromecast.  I had to open YouTube, connect, and then stop playing via Chromecast.  I wish there was a control directly in the iPad app.On my iMac, I played HBOGO via Chrome browser.  It did play on the TV via Chromecast, but with a bit of a lag.I going to try to use it in France to see if it will work there too.  I'll update the review at that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "26    AMAZING system for watching/working/playing on my laptop via our big screen tv. Some functionality is annoying, but overall this system is incredible. Setup is very quick and use of device is fairly self explanatory. Definitely considering one for each television in our home and one for travel! Maybe we can say goodbye to poor cable tv during hotel stays!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "27    An amazing device.  \"casting\"  Netflix or YouTube from an Android phone or tablet is seamless and in high definition quality.  It is also possible to cast video streaming on your computers Chrome browser to the device en full resolution.  this seems to require a fairly modern computer and a good wifi connection. I am using and i5 Mac mini and a $35 Asus wireless N router. the trick is that when streaming video opens in a popup window you copy the URL and paste it back into a regular chrome tab. Then you simply cast that tab and voila its on your TV screen.There were some minor issues with the Actiontec verizon fios router that are documented on internet forums. I eventually got it set up but decided to purchase a new router since the wireless and was much faster and provide better coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Google does not a good job this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "33    As a fan of Google TV from the beginning, I have to say that I was intrigued by the idea of the Chromecast.  It basically sets up the idea that apps for your TV don't actually have to be powered by your TV or a device connected to your TV, but instead, powered by your smart phone, tablet or Chrome browser.  This allows for the cost of the streaming device to be significantly reduced, instead of the higher priced Google TV and Apple TV devices of the past few years.The Chromecast is essentially this:  a device that responds to commands from various apps on your smart phone, tablet or Chrome browser.  These commands tell the Chromecast to begin to pull the stream from your wireless router.  Some reviews I have seen incorrectly stated that the Chromecast is just a wireless HDMI device which relies on the tablet, smart phone or other originating device to actually play content, and then mirror it on the TV screen.  This is not the case, except for when you are using a Chromebook Pixel to mirror what you are doing in Chrome.When not mirroring, the Chromecast does great!  Just as good as a Google TV or Apple TV device.  However, when mirroring on a Chromebook Pixel, video lags tremendously, so don't think you are going to be able to watch all sorts of alternative streaming sites that aren't supported directly, just because you can mirror your device.That being said, more and more apps are being added to the support list every month!The only other downfall I see is that you still have to switch inputs on your TV to use it.  After being babied by the integration with regular TV that Google TV affords, I myself do not wish to use a Chromecast in its current form.  However, for those that have cut the cable already, and don't watch regular HD broadcast TV, then it's a perfect fit!I gave it 4 stars due to the lack of a coaxial input for regular broadcast TV to be integrated (as Google TV does) which requires you to switch inputs, as well as due to the fact that it lags so much when mirroring content with a Chromebook Pixel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "34    As a musician I am on YouTube a lot and theD-Link MovieNite Streaming Media PlayerI purchased for that was not as reliable nor as versatile as I had hoped. This device, though was practically made for connecting YouTube to my TV and controlling it with my Samsung Galaxy Note II or my wheezing old Windows XP laptop.Yes, this will do more than YouTube, but I also have a Roku and that does the Amazon Prime movies I want. This is my YouTube box and it works perfectly.  Installation entailed first plugging this into one of the two HDMI ports on my TV and attaching power. Since my TV has an USB port I use it for power, but the device comes with a wall wart for a USB cable too. The next step required downloading the Chromecast and YouTube apps for my Note II and connecting to my network. Now when I bring up YouTube there is a 'Cast' icon I can press to watch whichever videos or clips I bring up in a search or from my favorites.The app I loaded also will detect and work on my friend's Chromecast when I am at her house, so in a way this is a universal remote. She is using an iPhone 4S and went through basically the same install process, although she is also using NetFlix with hers. Like me she has a Roku plugged into her second HDMI port. She uses that device more than I do, but out needs are different.Overall, I can heartily recommend this for folks who spend a lot of time on YouTube, even if they have another streaming box like the Roku. I am not so sure that I would get this as a general purpose streaming device - at least at this point - if I wanted movies from other sources. In that category the Roku seems to have many more options (at this point in time) and is a more mature and versatile platform. However, for YouTube this is THE solution in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "35    As a true consumer reviewer I always like to start my reviews with this caveat, I review based on what the manufacturer says the product can do.  I then compare that to what users feel the product should do and provide a Pro's which explains areas that the product goes above and beyond with their functionalities and Con's where I (my personal feeling) recommend areas I believe the product should improve in.  Star's are taken away from the product when it fails to deliver what the manufacturer said the product could do.The Chromecast viewer is a great viewer display technology.  It definitely makes TV watching easy, economical and practical.  Big different that consumers should be aware of, this is not a Roku or an Apple TV competitor.  Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.  Same applies for the phone, i only have apps that are compatible with Chromecast so no issues there.  But i am sure in this community of users that have different needs that maybe an impact somewhere down the line, but for 35 bucks amazing product.Pros:-  Easy to setup.  Not difficult at all but it does require a degree of understanding of your TV an knowing your wifi password.-  Delay is pretty amazing, from computer to Chromecast only about a 1 second delay.  Beats the pants off of Netgear's products and Windows 8 screen display technology-  Audio quality is great, its an HDMI adapter so make sure you have HDMI on your TV-  The software needed to run is simple to use.  One click of a button and its up and running.-  Small and non intrusive.Cons:-  Google needs to add better user instructions on setup.  I know they have a guide but it would be nice on screen-  A win 32 agent or a .dmg app would be nice.  I understand its more to maintain but for this type of technology it would be nice to be able to see local machine videos and movies.

       "39    As of today I am finally ready to give the Chromecast 5 stars.Being able to use your phone as a controller is a rather neat idea and since almost everyone has smart phones it works out quite well. Set up is quick and easy, and using it with the apps on your phone is also easy.Up until today there was a severe lack of apps that could be used with it, which basically limited you to using netflix or hulu. But with the introduction of plex support, the chromecast has finally gotten to where I think it needs to be and you can finally stream local content. There are still quite a few more streaming services that need to be added (amazon instant video for one) but it is definitely getting better every day and is probably only a matter of time.For the price, and the features it now supports you really can't go wrong, and I honestly can't see myself purchasing any other streaming box anytime soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "40    As others have mentioned, this product is way too restrictive.  I had envisioned all of my media needs met by this device, but Google only supports certain streaming apps.  I have a slingbox and an app, but I can't cast the stream unless I play it on my computer, then cast it from a chrome tab.  If you want to cast your computer, you again have to have Chrome to do so.  Google has forced customers to download their browser to use part of the features, which I don't care for.Playing anything outside of the supported apps requires you to 1) buy a powerful computer and 2) download chrome  3) hassling with the computer to play it.  This process should all be seamless.I will be trying the Miracast Video Receiver which is on sale for $20 around the web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "41    At first I bought my Chromecast as a toy to show off here and there, but as they updated it and as I had more friends swing by the place, I found out how useful it is.First, it's quicker than turning on my ps3 to watch HuluPlus or NetFlix.The big one though is Youtube.  And yeah, everything can do youtube.  But there is a level of convenience here that is outstanding.Friends come by, everyone logs into your wifi on their phones, tablets, even laptops, and we can all share the same queue instantly on youtube. everyone can pause/skip. And suddenly you've accidentally started a youtube party.  It's a lot more convenient than the pairing process that leanback and ps3/360/roku have since your wifi password is fine.Even if a PC or laptop logs into your wifi the youtube website has chromecast options built into it.But anyway, after watching every Epic Rap Battles of History video there is and an assortment of anime music videos 2 of the 5 people who came by my house have already said they're buying a chromecast too.As the owner of a smart-TV, I prefer the chromecast over any of the TVs build in functions. So it can also be thought of as a super easy way to turn any TV in to a smart TV.I did have to plug in the USB power but that wasn't much of an inconvenience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3766  First- I have two of these. One is used in a guest room at home, while the other is used in a commercial environment to drive a HDTV used for internal announcements (for now).I only use Apple products (iOS and OS X) at home. At work- we currently use a PC with the Chrome Chromecast plugin.I'll start with the home environment:When it works, it is great. I've had recurring issues connecting to it though, and re-connecting after locking a device. I mostly just use it in the Netflix app, so I suppose the blame could be pointed at them, but since this was a \"flagship\" app- I expect better. After the Chromecast starts- it often takes a couple of re-starts of the Netflix app to get it to show up. It rarely shows up when I first launch the Netflix app. I've also occasionally had to restart the Chromecast to get it to show up as an option as-well. I've also had problems re-connecting to control the Chromecast after playback has started but the device goes to sleep. Just to try to illustrate this...I will wait until the Chromecast shows it's online (in its screen-saver).I'll start Netflix on my iPad or iPhone, and start playing a movie or TV show. More often than not- the Chromecast icon won't show up.I'll have to force-quite Netflix, start it again. I may have to repeat this a couple of times.Eventually- the Chromecast icon will show up and I can play the show via it on the HDTV, controlling it on the device.Now, eventually my device will go to sleep/lock to save power. The show will continue playing on the Chromecast. (This is good.)If I open up Netflix on my device again- there seems to be about a 50% chance that it won't show the Chromecast controls or even acknowledge that the Chromecast is there again.Sometimes- I can restart the app and reconnect to the Chromecast. Often the only way to actually shut down the show streaming via the Chromecast is to power it off.I believe all of this is due to poor Wifi management stability on the Chromecast.I've used it on an iPhone and two different iPads, all have the same stability issues.Similarly- we have problems with the one used commercially as-well. It frequently disconnects from the WiFi network, or from the Chrome browser we show the content in. The Chromecast itself is line-of-sight to a commercial WiFi hotspot and less than 10' away from it. So- the display we are trying to drive more-often-than-not shows the Chromecast screen saver, and not the browser content. The browser content is on a dedicated PC with no power management or even screen-saver turned on. It is on the same WiFi network.On a related note- we found the Chromecast plug-in for Chrome on Mac to be completely worthless. It will often not even show the Chromecast, and when it does- it disconnects within a minute every time. We can't get anything to stream to it from a Mac for more than a few seconds. iPads and iPhones work fine, except they have the same stability problems for the initial connection and control interface as the home unit does. Streaming from the Chrome browser on iDevices is currently not supported, so that isn't an option.I'm sure it probably works flawlessly on a newer Android device, but if you have Apple products- you are better off with an Apple TV, and I can't recommend it if you want to stream from a PC Web browser. This is a relatively new product, and I'm sure they will introduce stability enhancements over-time. You can't beat it for the price, obviously, which is why I am still giving it three stars. When it is actually streaming- the video quality seems to be on-par with other streaming media players. At this point- it is definitely not a substitute for more-advanced streamers like AppleTV or Roku. That may change, and if I notice an improvement- I'll update this review. As of now- we are pulling it from the commercial install and switching to a long HDMI cable. (We were trying to minimize cables, and though the Chromecast would be a great solution.) At home- I will continue to use it, and just deal with the disconnects for now. If I used that room more often- I would swap it out for an AppleTV or Roku.                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "3767  Gives the little extra to make limited smart TV allowing netflix and Crome also many things you do with your chrome browser, you can show on TV. Learning new things here and there. For the cost, I think it is worth it.

It was a lot of fun for us to open our packages from each other that had the same item in them!This device does the single best job of bringing a level of &#34;smart&#34; to my TV that I have ever had the pleasure of using. In fact, this device is the first time I have been able to get my wife to use media that isn't TV native. She never liked using the Xbox, the Wii, the Media Center, or any of the other techniques that I liked to play around with. The Chromecast is basically used more by her than it is by me now.Plug and play easy, with a simple guided set up process has it running in about 5 minutes, Once you are set up, the limits of &#34;TV&#34; just start disappearing. There are a number of apps that can utilize Chromecast already, and the number is growing, which means my old &#34;dumb&#34; TV is only growing more powerful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3770  I bought this as a gift for my daughter for her relatively new TV.  She didn't want to replace a relatively new DVD player in order to stream Netflix, HULU or Pandora etc.  This little device turned her TV into a SMART TV and she loves it!!

No more having to mess with my BlueRay player's poor Netflix player, having to plug a phone or a laptop in for Pandora or other music, and don't have to futz with finnicky remotes. Switch to Chromecast input, and use my phone or laptop. Casting tabs in Chrome is great for watching videos anywhere besides YouTube, and showing friends and family stuff online.My one beef is you need a good router and internet connection, otherwise you can tend to drop the connection, but that's not Google's fault. And it's so much cheaper than the other options, and designed to work with my Android devices. For around $30, It's a no-brainer!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3773  I love this thing. So far, all I use it for is YouTube. I can quickly transfer any YouTube video I'm watching on my iPhone 5s or iPad Air onto my living room TV instantly. HD resolution begins quickly. One of the coolest features is that you can still use your device for other things, such as browsing the internet, playing games, checking email, while the YouTube video is playing on the TV. Very cool. For this reason alone, I give it 5 starts because it was only $30! I can't wait to see all the cool stuff Google might do with this thing in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3774  The only downside I see in this product is that you must ALWAYS have the mobile device or computer available to get the content. There is no remote to get you into content a La Roku. But then again this device is increadibly affordable. I can cast content on my mobile and walk away or open a tab in my Chrome browser and do some other activity while the movie or video is streaming in another room (must be on the same network wired/wireless or combo doesn't matter). I've also found a way to use plex to stream local media content from my local network, great for home movies!Again, I half wish this had a remote seperate that I could browse the network from but then I guess that defeats the idea of CASTING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3775  Update:Using the Chromecast for however long it has been out now, I like it. However, I kind of wish I invested in a good HDMI for my laptop instead.  I never cast YouTube or Netflix from my iPad or my phone, which leaves using it exclusively for my laptop.  I hear the tab-casting is still in beta mode, but I wish it was better. Netflix and YouTube are not the movie/film-viewing sites that I often use, and any other sites would experience delay/lagging/disconnection with the tab casting via the Chrome browser.  I've seen my sister use her phone to cast Netflix onto your family TV and it works superbly (you can even leave the house or your phone can die and it will still play).  The tab casting, I feel, relies on good reliable internet.  If you don't have a good connection, don't have any hopes of watching anything on the TV.  However, even with the best connection (which I have), you WILL experience technical difficulties.  It's still a good product, but there are still major improvements that need to be made.  Not worth the price for where it is, developmentally speaking.//I initially ordered a Chromecast from the Google website and it just came in last night. Although I haven't had it for too long, I'm sure I know of how well or poorly it works.The dongle itself is great, it saves the hassle of having to connect a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable to watch something on the big screen. My TV actually has a USB port, so an external source of power was not necessary. The dongle powers up by itself after the TV is turned on, and the input is selected (depending on where you inserted the Chromecast). I initially had trouble, I couldn't get the set up screen to come up. I only had a black screen with a few white dots at 480p. After going online to learn how to trouble shoot it, it turns out all I needed to do was unplug it, click the reset button a couple of times (to make sure it wasn't jammed), and then plug it back in. The set up was easy. Downloaded and installed Chromecast on all of my devices (both Android and IOS) in no time.For the longest time, I've been using my TV as an external monitor, more for movies than anything. The fact that I am unable to see documents on the big screen (like I ever did that anyways) is tad disheartening, but I got over it. It takes a little while for something to be cast on to the TV, and at times, the connection can fail (I had it happen once so far).  The Youtube app had to be cast and then loaded before what I was watching was on the screen. Having something casted isn't as instantaneous as I had hoped, but I'm willing to work with it.I don't often use Netflix or Amazon for movies. I'm more preferential toward third-party sites for my movies. I was worried that the movies wouldn't cast on my Macbook, but it did. But when it did, I was worried I'd have to watch it small-screen with the Google Chrome browser clearly evident. However, I noticed that after I clicked the full-screen button, the movie expanded on both my Macbook and the TV, but, you can still multi-task due to the multiple desktop function of the Macbook (which is a lifesaver)! Simply swipe to another desktop to start/continue working on something else.I'm still in the process of looking for an extension or app of Google Chrome that would allow me to play music from my Itunes, which would make the Chromecast amazing in all aspects. But so far, my searches have come up empty-handed.For a small, convenient dongle that allows you to cast and watch movies from electronic devices to the big screen, the price is great. A decent Thunderbolt to HDMI cable would cost as much, and wouldn't allow you to connect your devices to the TV. For $35, it's a good buy. I'm hoping that there will be more updates to improve the 'syncing' and smooth playing of the movies and media. Other than that, I see no problem with it. I'm actually ordering another one from Amazon for my parents (it costs less than Google because of the shipping).Easy to use.Convenient.Try it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3777  Was very excited about this unit when I purchased it. Couldn't wait for it to arrive in my mail box.Positives:Very easy to set up - 5 starsNetflix and youtube runs perfect from my android phone/macbook - 5 starFree 3 months of Netflix - 5 starBetter than Apple TV if you have an Android phoneNeutral:Only Netflix, Google Play and Youtube are supported right now. Hopefully support for other apps will show up soon.Negatives:Laptop mirroring was terrible. The mirrored screen from my MBA on my TV was extremely poor in quality, pretty much un-readable.The mirroring was also very slow. There's about a 1-2 second lag time from what you see on the laptop to what you see on your TV screen.I was mostl excited about the mirroring feature on my Chromecast. But I was extremely disappointed in the results.Overall, disappointing mirroring performance. However, it's still well worth the $35 price tag, especially with the 3 month Netflix deal.I will be buying more of these as Christmas presents for friends and Family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "3780  This is a great device - plugs into an HDMI port on a video device (aka TV) which then displays whatever is streamed to it. It really is the size of a large thumb drive.Pros -* Cheap!* Small* No IAPs or licensing or recurring costs* Updates its own firmware - adds new services, supports, etc.Cons -* Despite being small, it does have a power cord. I guess HDMI does not provide power, or enough power.* Not (yet?) integrated into core operating systems. So, only applications that support it will send their content.  Right now, I only know of one application - Google Chrome - that broadcasts, but I know there is at least or two others.  Since Chrome will broadcast, it will (should?) broadcast every browser based movie service, etc..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3781  Great with you tube and netflix. When I watch you tube, sometime the video stays still. Only fix I found is to reboot chromecast. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3783  Lets be realistic - any product like this is going to have its limitations and this one does. However, for what it does and the price point this is one heck of a product.  Works as advertised - maybe a little quirky and definitely an engineered by Google for a Google world product.  Simple to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3785  Got this when it was on sale a few weeks back as part of our &#34;testing of the waters&#34; on what it would be like to &#34;cut the cable&#34; and get off of FIOS.  It seems to work well when streaming You Tube videos but is completely unreliable when streaming off of TV sites directly such as PBS.  I get a lot of connection drops when streaming the TV sites.  I've yet to subscribe to Netflix or Hulu Plus, so am hoping that using either of those services work better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3786  I bought a 6' cable to go with my Google Chromecast Stick because I wasn't sure what came with it.  Turns out the cable that comes with the Chromecast works fine and is about 6&#34; in length.  Just wish Amazon Prime was playable on the Chromecast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3787  I can't express how helpful it is for me, it gives you more space between your tv and your devices, now I can stream movies and videos I like wherever in the room and the resolution is awsome enough to play 720p.  I hope this common is helpful for buyers like me. Go for it! Even for the price of this device, it is worth to just give it a try!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3788  I bought one of these last year and was sorely disappointed with its locked-down, forced partnerships with online streaming companies and promptly returned it. Lack of local media sharing capabilities really was the deal breaker for me. They seemed to have listened to all the complaints, and woken up to the swell of competition coming out of cheap overseas devices.EDIT 03-15-14: WARNING, Google just forced an update download on this unit. This unit will no longer setup without an internet connection, and will not function at an isolated guest network AP. Be aware, if you are planning to use this device on the road, such as at a hotel or other place where you will not have administrative capacity to configure the wireless router, this device will probable have problems, where as Tronsmart & Cheerlink like devices will function. Tronsmart & Cheerlink both function over their own AP network (in otherwords, they create their own little WiFi network), so they can function even in places without any other equipment, just a phone, a TV, and the HDMI adapter. Google Chromecast REQUIRES an external WiFi router to be connected to. It will not even setup without an internet connection. Google, one step forward, two steps back.I GAVE it a better rating after repurchasing it and testing out its capabilities. It can now cast local streaming content from the various apps that are available that perform this type of streaming. It comes packaged with a small extension for poorly designed TVs with tight fitting HDMI port on the back. Also comes with a standard wall jack adapter in addition to the USB for power, whereas most of the other devices I've purchased only comes with the USB cable, or is a split cord with WiFi/antenna unit. The setup is NO LONGER straightforward, due to the recent forced update download.Only three small drawbacks I see so far with this unit.[1] I can not connect this if I am using a hidden non-broadcasting SSID on my network. The other similar casting devices I own can.[2] Forced upgrades. The other devices I own require me to upgrade the firmware/software. Chromecast does it automatically without my permission or consent. This worries me. This type policy leaves the unit open to abuse. If some CEO at Google decides to take this in a new direction and changes the functionality that I don't like (for example, implementing DRMs or collecting market research data, etc.), there's not a whole lot I can do about it. I'll have to be lucky enough to catch wind of it before I plug mine in and be careful to only use the device when it can't connect to internet. It is also a poor way to do it, for technicalities. If I happen to be on a really terrible internet connection, the update could take a long time, and I might prefer to do this when I'm on a better connection. If I need the unit to simply function, for example, I'm late for meeting where I need to use this unit for a presentation, this would not be an appropriate time to perform an update. Bottom line, updating ought to be my choice of whether, when and where.[3] I still can't mirror my phone for those situations where apps are not supported but I want to throw their image up on the TV anyway. From what I hear we aren't too far from it though as the SDKs were released (Koush was working on one). EDIT 03-15-14: I now see some Apps coming out for mirroring. Unfortunately, due to the recent update Google forced on my unit, it will be sometime before I can get a chance to reconfigure my Chromecast to test this functionality.Hopefully, other large companies will learn from this earlier fiasco, and stop trying to force subscriptions & partnerships on it's customers. Such actions will only invite smaller competitors to develop solutions that the customers want, that these larger corporations try to lock down. Now that the SDKs are available, they will see how much better this strategy is. People will figure out new and wonderful ways of using this technology, and Google can reap the benefits together, with increased unit sales and visibility, instead of fighting against the customers for control and losing in public relations.A step in the right direction. Open it up. If everyone shares in it's development, everyone gets a bigger benefit from it. Even you, Google. It's a win/win.   \n",
       "3789  Second one I have bought, easy to set up and allows me to stream darn near anything to the big screen.

       "3791  It does what it says, once you allow it it to update it's Firmware, which takes place automatically over the WiFi.Until that happens, it may give you intial lagged responses.But I bought more units after I figured out how to install it properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3793  Yes, I've got an older Samsung LCD television that doesn't have the built-in &#34;Smart TV&#34; ability to receive Netflix or other streaming services. I wasn't about ready to junk my TV and buy a new one so I ended up watching Netflix on my 19&#34; monitor hooked up to my desktop computer.I knew that Roku, Apple TV and other streaming media players were out there but I was only looking to be able to stream Netflix and YouTube to my LCD television-- I really did not care about having access to other media channels (some free and some not). I think that this is Chromecast's &#34;niche&#34;.With Chromecast, I am able to watch Netflix and YouTube on my 40&#34; HD LCD TV. An added plus is that I can control what is being streamed to my TV using my tablet, Android phone or computer. I am able to watch all the Netflix & YouTube that I want using the inexpensive $35 Chromecast dongle. If you are reading this review, I assume that you've done your homework and seen how much more expensive Roku, Apple TV and other media players are. For me, the decision AND purchase was painless.The on-screen setup of the Chromecast was very easy. I was up and streaming in under 10 minutes. I love this thing!!!The only drawback (and it has nothing to do with the Chromecast) that I've noticed is that if you are watching a non-HD video from YouTube on your phone or tablet, it's going to look even worse when you &#34;cast&#34; it on your big screen HDTV. Luckily, more people are posting videos in HD on YouTube.If your needs are similar to mine, get it. At $35, can you really go wrong???  =)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3794  For those like me wanted something to put videos and other internet media on their tv this is a great device. I started with a wireless hdmi device, and it was very pixely. This on the other hand works great. Only issues i've noticed is if you have a slower internet connection, and are streaming from a non youtube/ netflix site (where the player is built into the site)  the video will leg a little bit behind the sound, but to me that is to be expected.For those who are more techsavy and are developers of Mobil platform (windows and android, havent tested IOS and never plan to) this will cause issues like a virtual box would and the easiest way to get around it (in windows) is to go to your nextwork connections -&#62; change adapter settings, and disable all but wifi / ethernetAs for help from chromecast support, it sucks, i suggest just researching how to solve the problem on your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3795  This thing seemed like it would have worked fine.  I only wanted something to stream Netflix.  However, living on a college campus, I found that we implement something called &#34;device isolation&#34; which prevents the Chromecast from speaking with my phone, tablet, laptop, and pc on the network.  Since there is no actual remote control for this, I was unable to use it.  I went with the Roku LT instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3796  I have to travel quite a bit for my job.  I love that I don't have to watch CNN stories over and over again in my hotel room.  Now I can just plug this into the tv and watch all my favorite Netflix flicks hassle free.  It's a pity it doesn't have Amazon video yet, but it's well worth the $35.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3797  I could not use this in the back of my home theater receiver, even with the short, short USB Extender cable.  The receiver and the cabinet probably degrade the Wi-Fi signal too much.  Even connected to the rear of the flat-screen tv it required some poditioning to get Wi-Fi to work in a room with great coversge.  Maybe that is the unit I have, but it is modtly okay so it isn't worth an exchsnge to see if another does better.Tested this with three Chromebooks and the iOS App and it seems to work, but it seems more of a techie toy, at the moment, than a mainstream device.Hard to beat the price, but this will be obsolete after you buy your next smart tv.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
